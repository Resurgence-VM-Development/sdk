# Resurgence Assembler (RASM)
RASM is a rudimentary assembly compiler / assembler for the Resurgence
instruction set and bytecode format. It is written in Python and is very
hastily written. Because of this, it has many flaws, and should not be used
for any serious applications. Ideally, it should be completely rewritten with
a better design. For now, it is sufficient for testing and demonstration
purposes.

## System Requirements
RASM requires a recent version of Python 3 and the Python standard libraries.
RASM does not have any other notable dependencies.

## Usage
```
./rasm.py [path to assembly code file] [path to output rvm file]
```
For example, to compile the fizzbuzz sample program:
```
./rasm.py ../sample-programs/fizzbuzz.asm ../sample-programs/fizzbuzz.rvm
```
Where the ASM file is the source code, and the RVM file is the destination for
the generated bytecode.

## Assembly Language Format
To see examples of the assembly language used by this assembler, see the
`sample-programs` directory of the Resurgence SDK.
